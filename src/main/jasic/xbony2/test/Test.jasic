CLASS Test

 This is a non-jasicdoc multi-line comment. Notice how the code below has no brackets, it's all based on lines and
 spaces.

DEF main(String[] args)
	Console.out "Hello world!" #The console class is automatically imported, like in java System is automatically imported.
	Console.out "-Love JASIC" #This a single-lined comment btw.
	
	IF 6 > 5
		Console.out("This should happen :P") #Using parentheses is optional for methods with only one input, like you saw 
	ELSE									 #before.
		Console.out "Wait, this shouldn't hapen!"
		
	THIS.outputSomethingFancly "Hi" #Using a method within a class
